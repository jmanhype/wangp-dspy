## Description
Dogfood finding (story 6 / WD-t6i7).

_check_venv (os.path.isfile/X_OK), the settings.json write, and the readback scan all assume the Wan2GP checkout is on the LOCAL filesystem. When the GPU box is remote (3090), the dogfood had to bend the runner; paths validated locally do not exist remotely and vice versa.

Fix: introduce a renderer-locality seam — e.g. a path-mapping layer (local path <-> remote path) or an explicit remote mode where settings write, venv check, and readback go through the runner/ssh transport. Keep the current local behavior default; RED tests with a fake transport first.
